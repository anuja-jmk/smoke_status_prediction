Using features like age, height, weight, waist, hearing, eyesight, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, AST, ALT, Gtp, dental caries etc, to predict if a person is a smoker or not. Modelled as a binary classification problem, solved using 3 classifiers - logistic regression, support vector machine and artificial neural networks.
